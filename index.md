Hi! I am Yao Zhang, a third-year PhD student in Astronomy at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My research focuses on the interplay between **reionization** and **cosmology**, particularly reionization's impact on **Lyα forest, 21 cm intensity mapping** and **baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements**. I am also passionate about understanding observational signatures of **dark matter models**, such as Warm Dark Matter (WDM).

## Research Interests

- **Cosmology & Reionization**  
  Modeling hydrogen and helium reionization and their observational consequences on the high-redshift universe.

- **Dark Matter Physics**  
  Investigating observational imprints of various dark matter models using Lyα forest and 21 cm intensity mapping.

- **Computational Astrophysics**  
  Developing and running large-scale cosmological simulations for reionization and galaxy formation.
