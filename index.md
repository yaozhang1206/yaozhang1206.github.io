# Welcome to My Academic Website

Hi! I am Yao Zhang, a third-year PhD student in Astronomy at Tsinghua University. My research focuses on the interplay between **Helium II reionization** and the intergalactic medium (IGM), particularly its impact on **LyÎ± forest** and **baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements**. I am also passionate about understanding observational signatures of **dark matter models** such as **Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM)**, **Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM)**, and **Primordial Black Holes (PBH)**.

## Research Interests

- **Cosmology & Reionization**  
  Modeling hydrogen and helium reionization and their observational consequences on the high-redshift universe.

- **Dark Matter Physics**  
  Investigating observational imprints of various dark matter models using **weak lensing** and other astrophysical probes.

- **Computational Astrophysics**  
  Developing and running large-scale cosmological simulations for reionization and galaxy formation.
